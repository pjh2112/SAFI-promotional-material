<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<hr />
<p>SAFI, or School of Agriculture for Family Independence, is a
non-profit organization based in Lilongwe, Malawi. Following a
devastating famine, SAFI was started in 2002 as a sustainable solution
to widespread food insecurity. Since then, SAFI has helped thousands of
Malawians achieve food security and make progress across a range of
other critical aspects of life. SAFI focuses on providing skills and
knowledge that will help their beneficiaries make lasting change in
their lives, solving problems at their root.</p>
<p>This report outlines the transformative reach of three of SAFI’s most
impactful programs—Self-Reliance, Educate the Children, and Wells of
Hope—through firsthand interviews and on-site data collection. The
stories of 48 beneficiaries, reflected in the data in this report,
reveal how these interventions extend outward, lifting families and
transforming entire communities. Behind every statistic is a story of
growth, hope, and sustainable change.</p>

<div id="program-impact-overview" class="section level1">
<h1>Program impact overview</h1>
<div id="self-reliance" class="section level2">
<h2>Self-Reliance</h2>
<hr />
<p>SAFI’s Self-Reliance Program empowers rural Malawian families through
intensive agricultural training and leadership development. The program
teaches modern farming techniques, business skills, family relations,
and gender equity—with the ultimate goal of increasing crop yields,
income, and household stability.</p>
<p>Each year, SAFI selects a cohort of students from across Malawi to
participate in their training programs at the SAFI campus in Mtalimanja.
Depending on the program, students spend between two weeks and six
months on campus, where they receive hands-on instruction from experts
in crop science, livestock care, nutrition and business management.
Students participating in the year-long program are given a plot of land
on which to cultivate their crops over the period of six months,
allowing them the opportunity to practice in real time. After being
trained on campus, the students return home to begin applying and
sharing their knowledge in their local communities.</p>
<p>A key innovation of the program is the <strong>Lead Farmer
Model</strong>. Upon returning home, the graduates train and mentor
anywhere from 15 to 100 “follower farmers.” This peer-to-peer approach
dramatically increases SAFI’s reach and the impact of the program: a
cohort of 40 lead farmers can directly impact thousands of rural farmers
across the country.</p>
<p>The impact of SAFI’s self-reliance program can be seen through both
quantitative and qualitative data. The following table and graphs show
the increase in both harvest and income reported by beneficiaries:</p>
<div id="quantitative-impact" class="section level3">
<h3>Quantitative Impact</h3>
<p>SAFI’s Self-Reliance program shows measurable improvements in both
economic and agricultural development. The following table shows the
average gains reported by both lead farmers and follower farmers in
terms of harvest and income increase.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">

<p><b>Key Findings:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Average maize harvested by beneficiaries increased by over
5x.</p></li>
<li><p>Yearly household income increased by an average of over
12x.</p></li>
<li><p>Farmers previously making no money from soy produce were able to
make an average of $165 per year.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p><em>While these numbers may seem small, keep in mind that the average
GDP per capita in Malawi was just /$602 in 2022, ranking 179th out of
194 countries in the world</em> <span class="citation">(Macrotrends,
2024)</span>.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="qualitative-impact" class="section level3">
<h3>Qualitative Impact</h3>
<p>During interviews, beneficiaries from the Self-Reliance program
overwhelmingly described improvements in economic security, food
availability, and household well-being. Reported outcomes include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Increased food security (56%)</p></li>
<li><p>Improved nutrition (48%)</p></li>
<li><p>Greater community cohesion and growth (32%)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When asked how they used their increased income, participants
reported:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Covering basic household needs (56%)</p></li>
<li><p>Starting or expanding small businesses (56%)</p></li>
<li><p>Improving household infrastructure (bathrooms, kitchens, housing)
(52%)</p></li>
<li><p>Investing in livestock (48%)</p></li>
<li><p>Sending more children to school (%24)</p></li>
<li><p>Gaining personal independence and confidence</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The following table gives a more detailed breakdown of the
development markers:</strong></p>

</div>
<p>These findings highlight that SAFI’s Self-Reliance program goes far
beyond agricultural training. By investing in a small group of students
and equipping them to become change agents in their communities, SAFI
fosters sustainable growth in health, education, economic resilience,
and social equity. This multiplier effect ensures that each dollar
invested yields far-reaching and lasting results.</p>
<p>All this data is encouraging, but stories from the beneficiaries
themselves make the impact much more personal:</p>

<strong>&gt; Charity Gausi - A Family Transformed</strong>
</summary>
<p><em>Charity Gausi is a 32-year-old single mother, living in the
village of Chikunthu. Few would guess that because of her help, the
community has grown from facing huge challenges to welcoming even bigger
opportunity. Chosen to head out the SAFI initiatives of self-reliance,
Charity participated in a two-week course at SAFI campus to learn
livestock management, agroforesty, family relations, modernized farming,
and backyard garden techniques. Soon after returning home, she started
not only implementing these programs, but teaching 15 other families to
do the same.</em></p>
<p><em>Before being approached by SAFI, Charity and her young daughter
were facing food insecurity and low crop yield. Struggling to get a leg
up, Charity was lacking the knowledge and skill necessary to take her
limited resources and reach success. Nowadays, Charity has taken her
harvest from three bags of maize to 22—more than a 7x increase. On top
of this, she has multiplied her income by a factor of ten, now making
around MWK 700,000 a year thanks to her small business
endeavors.</em></p>
<p><em>Of all the students of Charity’s, each one now has a backyard
garden to source their own vegetables, sells the surplus of their crops,
and has invested in livestock. One student sticks out in particular
though—Charity’s mother, Grace. Since learning the new techniques from
SAFI, Grace has doubled her income and expanded her livestock
investments. She no longer struggles to find food, and can support all
her children and their basic needs. With all this prosperity, Grace’s
household has become a happier, more stable environment. “Without money,
we quarreled. Now, we work together and are happy,” she says. In the
future, Grace hopes to one day buy a car to get around, now that her age
is affecting her joints. “Thank you SAFI for what you have done in my
family and my community. Other communities need to benefit like we have.
I’m so grateful for what SAFI does!” We share the same sentiment. The
family and community impact of SAFI’s simple programs has effects that
ripple across generations, changing families, communities, and the
beautiful country of Malawi.</em></p>

<strong>&gt; Johannes and Gloria Phiri - Role Models for a Struggling
Community</strong>
</summary>
<p><em>In 2023, SAFI visited the village of Chukozo, looking to find
participants for their one-week self-reliance program. After speaking
with the village chief, Johannes Phiri was chosen to fill the role. He
would go to SAFI campus for one week to learn modernized farming
techniques, business management, agroforestry, and fruit cultivation
skills that he could then bring back to his village and teach others to
implement. Currently, he leads 42 other farmers in the village, teaching
them the about the skills SAFI has given him to increase his harvest and
make his farm sustainable. “We were only getting maybe half a bag of
soybeans, for example, but now we are able to get seven, eight bags of
soybeans. The maize, we used to harvest 2-3 bags before, but now we’re
able to get 60 bags.” Johannes says. With this increase, Johannes and
his wife have multiplied their income, making MWK 1.5 million from
selling the surplus from last year’s harvest. Visiting the farm, you can
see the impact that this program has had. With the extra money, the
family has invested in more livestock, rebuilt their house, bought more
land—they no longer go hungry at any point in the year. Every square
inch of their property is covered with trees, flowers, or crops.
Johannes mentioned that one of his sons has taken up the new farming
techniques, now selling a surplus and producing enough to feed his
family reliably.</em> <em>As for the community, Johannes says that much
has changed. Because of the food insecurity, theft of crops was very
common. Now that Johannes has helped so many farmers to start backyard
gardens, there is no longer any need to steal. The village is a safer,
better nourished community. Many fellow farmers have followed in
Johannes’ footsteps, making great strides in their economic progress. In
the future, Johannes and Gloria hope to build a better house, start a
commercial farm, and raise more livestock.</em></p>

<h2>Educate the Children</h2>
<hr />
<p>SAFI’s Educate the Children program focuses on paying the school fees
of children and young adults in need, allowing them crucial educational
opportunities that they would otherwise not be able to pursue. Only
about 15% of children complete secondary school due to high school fees
and material costs. This number is even lower in rural areas, ranging
between 2-10% completion in poor sectors <span
class="citation">(Molendijk, 2022)</span>.</p>
<p>As of now, SAFI sponsors about 250 students in total: 150 secondary
school students and 100 university students all across the country. SAFI
recruits students through an application process: students or their
parents apply for the scholarship and applicants are selected for
interviews. Students are selected based on individual need and potential
for success. Depending on the circumstances, SAFI pays for tuition,
accommodations, health-care costs, and food. Eight-nine dollars educates
a secondary school student for an entire year. For a university student,
the annual cost is $492 USD.</p>
<p>The following table shows the frequency of certain challenges faced
by students before receiving the scholarship:</p>

<p><b>Key Findings:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><p>79% of students said they would have dropped out without SAFI’s
help.</p></li>
<li><p>86% reported a lack of school fees, restricting them from
attending class and accessing necessary supplies.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>Many of these problems stem from greater social and economic issues
in the country of Malawi. However, SAFI’s Educate the Children program
proves effective in improving these problems and others.</p>
<p>When asked what benefits the students had seen in their lives after
receiving the scholarship, here were their answers:</p>

<li><p>50% reported higher employment and future education
opportunities.</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple students reported feeling happier and more hopeful about
their lives.</p></li>
<li><p>In terms of school performance, students reported higher grades,
increased participation in class, and better study habits.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This table also highlights the expansive impacts that this
program has had on families and communities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>At least 57% of sponsored students are the first in their
families to become educated.</p></li>
<li><p>64% of students reported seeing positive impact on their family
members: in some cases more stability for younger siblings, as well as a
positive impact on future generations Others reported hoping to pay
school fees for their future children or even using their education to
become teachers themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>36% mentioned becoming role models for their
communities.</p></li>
<li><p>86% expressed the desire to use their education to serve those in
need, with some students mentioning hopes of opening clinics and
hospitals or charity organizations.</p></li>

<strong>&gt; Thomas Mwale — a Duty to Serve</strong>
</summary>
<p><em>Thomas Mwale is a 42-year-old father of four—not one many would
expect to be studying at university. Eight years ago, Thomas was a
working professional struggling to pay for the needs of his family, like
many people in Malawi. He had dreams of serving the needy and pursuing
his passion of helping others. He enrolled in university courses
studying social work, but was unable to continue due to the tuition
cost. Facing the threat of dropping out but wanting to pursue his
dreams, he was presented with the opportunity to continue studying
through SAFI’s Educate the Children program. His dreams were back in the
realm of possibility, and Thomas took that possibility and ran with
it.</em> <em>Supported by SAFI, Thomas finished his degree in four
years. Since then, he has dedicated his life to seeking out vulnerable
students in rural villages—those unlikely to be able to become educated,
such as children of poor farmers, orphans, and the sick or handicapped.
Working within those communities, Thomas has been able to identify these
children, monitor their progress, and connect them with the necessary
support, such as health care and adoption programs. In connection with
the very program that supported his education, Thomas has provided
scholarships to over one hundred students. “I feel happy to see the kids
succeed. Some of them I found when they were seven or eight, now they’re
completing university,” says Thomas.</em> <em>But Thomas doesn’t plan on
stopping there. We met him at the Malawi College of Medical Science,
where he is working towards his certificate in public health. Soon
after, he plans on opening a hospital that specifically serves children
under five—the first of its kind in Malawi. “I see the challenges that
children face, and I have to help. The possibilities in the future of
these children is great, they just need some support.”</em> <em>Without
the SAFI’s support of one student, Thomas, hundreds of children in
Malawi would have been denied the opportunity to succeed and make a
difference. “The knowledge I have gained from school, I can communicate
to those in need. Without SAFI, I wouldn’t have the training necessary
to bring growth to the needy. We have to continue helping needy
students. I myself have benefitted, and many have benefitted because of
me. If SAFI didn’t support me, these kids wouldn’t have had a
chance.”</em> <em>Continued support to the Educate the Children program
doesn’t just help individuals—families and communities grow and
progress, leading the nation to prosperity through the simple act of
paying school fees.</em></p>

<strong>&gt; Massa Chunga — From Struggle to Service</strong>
</summary>
<p><em>Massa Chunga is a first year student at the Malawi College of
Health Science. Starting last week, he is adjusting to his new life in
Lilongwe. Massa is from a small village called Madisi, very close to
SAFI campus in the district of Dowa. Massa was raised by his godfather
after both of his parents passed away, and is the first member of his
family to pursue a college education. Upon finishing his education, he
will be the first in his community to become a doctor. Massa became
aware of the difficulties that many of his friends and family face daily
in trying to receive adequate medical care—there is no public hospital
in the village of Madisi, and very few could pay the expenses of private
clinics. This inspired Massa to want to become a doctor and help his
community by opening a clinic and offering free services to those who
cannot afford care. Massa commented that most people who become doctors
in Malawi stay in the capital of Lilongwe because of higher salaries. He
didn’t seem swayed by this, staying true to his motivation to help the
poor.</em></p>
<p><em>Up until now, Massa has been unable to pay the MK400,000 ($228
USD) per semester tuition to start his education. For the past eight
years, Massa has tried and failed to come up with the money. Massa still
faces challenges, walking everyday for two hours to reach campus. He
still lacks basic needs, often coming to school without enough food.
These things make it difficult, but his determination to his dream
wouldn’t let him quit. He has overcome many challenges up to this point
and refuses to give up. Now, SAFI pays his tuition and supplies him with
a small stipend to continue studying. Massa is grateful to SAFI for
allowing him the opportunity to pursue his dreams of serving the poor
and needy.</em></p>

population uses shallow wells or river water, which disproportionately
impacts women and children, who often bear the burden of water
collection.</p>
<p>The following table shows the frequency of certain challenges faced
by both beneficiaries of the program and those in the process of
receiving a borehole from SAFI:</p>

<div
style="border-left: 4px solid #007ACC; padding: 0.5em; background-color: #f9f9f9;">
<p><b>Key Findings:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><p>86% of participants reported getting sick from unsafe water
sources.</p></li>
<li><p>71% reported poor water quality and cleanliness from alternative
water sources.</p></li>
<li><p>Community wide problems such as crime, overcrowding, and water
scarcity are common.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>Since 2016, SAFI has drilled 169 boreholes all across Malawi, giving
reliable water to a total of over 20,000 people. At an average cost of
just $4,995, each borehole transforms the lives of an entire community.
By improving access to nearby clean water, the Wells of Hope program not
only reduces time and physical strain but also improves child health and
well-being while enabling families to spend more time and energy
investing in their education, agriculture, and small businesses.</p>
<p>But the impact goes far beyond water. As shown in the following
table, beneficiaries report wide-ranging improvements in health, safety,
nutrition, and community well-being—evidence of the massive impact just
one borehole can have.</p>

<h3>Beneficiary stories</h3>

<strong>&gt; Yohane Village, Mchinji District</strong>
</summary>
<p><em>Arriving to the village of Yohane in the district of Mnchinji,
you will be greeted by happy faces and voices singing welcome songs. The
village is bustling with life. This hasn’t always been the case—before
SAFI arrived in 2022 to build a borehole, many members faced the
insurmountable problem of water insecurity. Well water is often the only
solution—but it hardly is one. Women in the village used to spend hours
daily walking to a shallow well nearby, only to wait in overcrowded
lines to be using unsafe water. Many people suffered from diarrhea and
other illnesses when relying on the untreated well water. All this
changed however, when the village leaders were approached in 2022 to
become SAFI beneficiaries. Initially, SAFI hoped to start their
self-reliance program, teaching people to become independent farmers
with access to enough food. This proved a challenge however, when they
realized that doing so would be impossible without a reliable source of
water. “We proposed that they teach us how to construct a backyard
garden, but we don’t have enough water. They told us it was more
important that we drill a borehole, so we proposed that to them,” says
the village’s lead farmer.</em></p>
<p><em>Nowadays, water can be readily retrieved by just walking a few
minutes. The people have enough water for anything they need, and have
seen numerous improvements in their families and communities. Before,
many children were unable to go to school as their mothers couldn’t
fetch enough water to bathe them, wash their clothes, or cook for them.
Many students dropped out of school because of these challenges.After
the borehole has been drilled, the students have been able to return to
school. Their parents, with the newfound time, have built gardens,
irrigate their crops, and supply the basic needs for their homes.
Village members rotate cleaning duties and pay to supply parts and
maintenance, in order to keep things running smoothly.</em></p>
<p><em>The peace of mind afforded to hundreds of people in Yohane is
priceless. The benefits of the borehole extend much beyond just
water—the village is alive, and will continue to prosper. “We only thank
SAFI for drilling the borehole, because now we are so safe. We drink
clean water as I said, we construct backyard gardens and find food
easily. We just thank SAFI for drilling the borehole, all of our
problems have been solved!”</em></p>

<strong>&gt; Sunduza Village, Kasungu District</strong>
</summary>
<p><em>Filimoni Mtalimanja is the lead farmer of Sunduza, chosen by his
village chief to teach other members of the village about SAFI’s
life-changing interventions. There was only one problem—the village
depended on shallow, hand-dug wells from the nearby river. Village
members, mostly women, would spend hours walking to the river to
retrieve water, only to get sick from drinking it.</em></p>
<p><em>All of this changed last November when SAFI drilled a borehole to
support the members in their adoption of the self-reliance programs.
“Since the borehole was installed, we are healthier, there is a
reduction in diarrhea cases. Women no longer have to travel at night to
collect water, and are free from danger,” Filimoni says. Beyond that,
the people now have more time and energy to develop their homes and
village. With extra water to irrigate his backyard garden, Filimoni has
made enough profit to buy an oxcart. “The collective development of the
village, I see through my own home,” he says. Many members of the
village have followed Filimoni’s lead, implementing important
agricultural techniques that he learned through SAFI. In the future, he
hopes to see livestock and small business growth, as well as better
quality of life in his home.</em></p>
<p><em>Filimoni says, “I commend SAFI for what they have done in our
community. It has given us agricultural knowledge, sanitation, it has
also given us the borehole which has changed a lot of things in the
community. I ask that SAFI do this for more communities in this
country.”</em></p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>SAFI’s Self-Reliance, Educate the Children, and Wells of Hope
programs have transformed thousands of lives across Malawi. Each
initiative has delivered remarkable, measurable outcomes—increased crop
yields, full-tuition scholarships, and reliable access to clean water.
These results alone are worth celebrating. But the true impact reaches
much deeper. This is only a fraction of the story though. As
participants and community members consistently share, SAFI’s work
empowers families and uplifts entire communities. Children are returning
to school. Families are feeding themselves year-round. Women are leading
agricultural efforts and small businesses. Villages once defined by
scarcity are now building futures with confidence and hope.</p>
<p>This is not just aid—it’s lasting change. And with increased support,
SAFI can do even more.</p>
<p>Your partnership enables SAFI to expand its reach, deepen its
programs, and serve more families with the tools they need to break
cycles of poverty. Every donation directly fuels transformation—one
family, one community, one future at a time.</p>
